# Introduction
This project focus on binary classification and multiclassification

# Software Requirmemts
Runing binary_full and multiclass has certain software versioning requirements.
* R 4.2.0 or greater

# Running binary_full
binary_full just uses the glm function with binomial family to fit the data to predict the values.
its performance based on the training data is showed as follow:

and the accuracy is 1.(don't need to improve the performance)

# Running multiclass
## baseline algorithm
the baseline algorithm of multiclassication just uses the svm function with cost = 10 to fit the data to predict the values.
its performance based on the training data is showed as follow:

and the accuracy is 0.998455.

## improvement
we can tune the cost parameter and this figure shows the relationship between the cost and the number of support vectors:

and then we choose the best model which is svm function with cost = 100. And the performance based on the training data is showed as follow:

and the accuracy is 1.

# further improvement
according to the results below, we can see that many variables are highly correlated. Thus, we can delete or merge some highly correlated variables into one new variable.
